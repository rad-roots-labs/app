## Overview

Tangle is a decentralized social networking application built on the Nostr protocol. We are building it for farmers around the world to market their products, and share their activities and knowledge.

Built for adaptability to remote areas, Tangle is designed with offline-first principles and includes a local database and on-device geocoder. Upon network connection the application will synchronize local data to the Nostr network.
