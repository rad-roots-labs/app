# Contributing

Rad Roots is an open-source project, and we welcome all contributions — including code improvements, bug fixes, translations, new features, and bug reports.

## Translations

If you would like to contribute by translating the app into another language, please visit our [localisation repository](https://github.com/rad-roots-labs/packages-locales). To contribute translations:

1. *Fork the repository and add your language files following the existing structure.*

2. *Submit a Pull Request with your changes.*


If the language you would like to add translations for is not yet set up in the repository let us know by [opening an issue](https://github.com/rad-roots-labs/packages-locales/issues), or [email us](mailto:support@radroots.dev) and we will assist you in adding the required files.

## Development Environment

Ensure the required system dependencies are installed:

*Rust*
```bash
$ cargo --version
> cargo 1.88.0 (873a06493 2025-05-10)
```

*NodeJS*
```bash
$ node --version
> v20.18.0
```

*Yarn*
```bash

## Building

This app is implemented as a progressive web application using [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/), and maintained as a monorepository using [Turbo](https://turborepo.com/) with individual packages tracked as Git submodules. 

To begin, first clone the repository and set up your local working copy:

```bash
mkdir pwa && cd pwa

git clone https://github.com/rad-roots-labs/pwa .

git remote rename origin upstream

git remote add origin https://github.com/<YOUR-USERNAME>/pwa.git

git push -u origin master
```

Initialize and update Git submodules:
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Checkout Git submodules branches:
```bash
git submodule foreach 'git checkout $(git config -f $toplevel/.gitmodules submodule.$name.branch)'
```

Install the application dependencies:
```bash
yarn
```


Configure local environment variables:
```bash
echo 'VITE_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_RELAYS=ws://localhost:8080,ws://localhost:8081
VITE_PUBLIC_RADROOTS_RELAY=ws://localhost:8082
VITE_PUBLIC_RADROOTS_API=https://radroots.org
VITE_PUBLIC_KEYVAL_NAME=rad-roots-pwa-dev-v1
VITE_PUBLIC_NOSTR_CLIENT=»-`-,- rad roots' > app/.env.development
```

Build the application:
```bash
yarn build
```

Run the application in development mode:
```bash
yarn dev
```
